  # An interface to the Akismet spam detection service.
  #
  # === Comment Information
  #
  # The various Akismet request methods (e.g., #spam!, #ham!, #check) supported by this
  # class take a +params+ argument, which is a Hash of the following key values:
  #
  # <tt>:user_ip</tt> (required)::
  #    IP address of the comment submitter. Care must be taken to get this right when
  #    a gateway/reverse proxy or other intermediary is involved in the
  #    request. The +X-Forwarded-For+ request header can often be used to determine
  #    the IP in these scenarios.
  #
  # <tt>:user_agent</tt> (required)::
  #    The +User-Agent+ request header included with the comment submission
  #    request.
  #
  # <tt>:referrer</tt> (optional)::
  #    The +Referer+ request header included with the comment submission
  #
  # <tt>:permalink</tt> (optional)::
  #    The permanent location of the entry the comment was submitted to.
  #
  # <tt>:comment_type</tt> (optional)::
  #    May be blank, comment, trackback, pingback, or a made up value like "registration".
  #
  # <tt>:comment_author</tt> (optional)::
  #    Comment author's full name.
  #
  # <tt>:comment_author_email</tt> (optional)::
  #    Comment author's email address.
  #
  # <tt>:comment_author_url</tt> (optional)::
  #    Comment author's URL.
  #
  # <tt>:comment_content</tt> (optional)::
  #    The content of the comment that was submitted.
  #
  # === Other server enviroment variables
  #
  # In PHP there is an array of enviroment variables called $_SERVER which
  # contains information about the web server itself as well as a key/value
  # for every HTTP header sent with the request. This data is highly useful
  # to Akismet as how the submited content interacts with the server can be
  # very telling, so please include as much information as possible.
